The film follows both the underlying issues related to the disorders, as well as the manner and treatment the patients receive. Professor Ran Tao established the world's first internet addiction clinic, and he promises to cure children of so-called internet addiction, which has grown into one of China's most feared public health hazards. The program admits children between the ages of 13 and 18 years; they are forced to undergo military-inspired physical training and comply with monitored sleep and food standards. Throughout their stay at the clinic, they are patrolled by the military guards who protect the children's quarters, which, like prisons, are surrounded by gates and fences. Despite such conditions, parents voluntarily send their children to the treatment centre and relinquish personal involvement. There is no one-on-one therapy, and the children's psychological needs are 'met' with group therapy sessions twice a week. The treatment is very expensive, and parents often borrow money in order to afford to send their child to the clinic. For them it is worth it - steering their child away from this addiction and redeveloping direct communication skills takes priority. 'Web Junkie' provides a microcosm of modern Chinese life, examines intergenerational pressures, and takes a hard look at one of the symptoms of the internet age.", "Where one is becoming aware of his impotence the other is discovering her own sexuality and womanhood.

It's a territory for the dispossessed (the irony of its name not lost on anyone who enters or escapes) and for pickups, drug deals, and clashes with the law.

On the eve of World War II, more than 6,000 Jews lived in Sokal, a small town in Eastern Poland, now part of Ukraine. By the end of the war, only about 30 had survived, most of them rescued by Halamajowa.

A combination of chance and fate delude the protagonists throughout. The movie attempts to describe the life of individuals in contemporary Israeli society, and the almost impossible attempt to simply live one's life. Whether he is a regular citizen or an important \"boss\", the life of every Israeli is consciously or unconsciously shaped by the national state of affairs. This \"state of affairs\" filters into his life and into his very being, at times in a destructive and irrevocable manner. Most often, the individual remains unaware of the influence that the big picture - the country suffering tremendous pressures from both inside and outside - has on his personal state of being. This influence resembles a cloud hovering over us while we scurry about on the ground below - like aimless ants who have lost their hill. The movie represents Israel as a country already far beyond identity crises. This is a country where violence is a way of life, and which is governed by the world view of the \"stupid, the evil and the corrupt.\" This is a society reduced to gangs that coalesce and break up according to their needs. Anarchy is everywhere, and the perverse satisfaction of dark urges is taken for granted. The chaos this movie attempts to represent does not lie in the future. This is a world ruled by verbal, spiritual and physical violence, sexual harassment, rape, cunning, theft, arson, assault, eating disorders, cancer, post-trauma, hit-and-run accidents and other ailments. Within the chaos that envelops this perverse urban reality, mere chance appears to be the \"organizing principle.\" On one level, the game of chance is the result of violence being a two-edged sword. On the other hand, it partakes of the typically Israeli reality of chance encounters. The forced intimacy created by these encounters becomes reality due to the power of comradeship and companionship - born of the shared experience of different exigencies and of a language, a place and a given time. Beneath the surface, however, there constantly arise moments of longing, humaneness and compassion. They exist in this world as a kind of potential of which only few realize that it does exist. The same few that mourn the loss of a sense of purpose when the final avalanche of tears erupts at the end of the movie...", "N/A", "Reb Kalman, the matchmaker comes home on Shabbat to find out that Reb Pinchas has been there.

The tune of the melody can be found in many variations. Among these: a Flemish National Song, a Polish air, a Turkish melody, an ancient Italian song, a Swedish ditty called Ack, V\u00e4rmeland, a Basque national song, the opening of the symphonic poem The Moldau, by Czech composer Bedrich Smetana, and others.

You can get straight inside, sit comfortably in the driver's seat, and enjoy that \"new car smell\" - then all you have to do is choose the right key and drive away. Sounds easy, right? But is it...? Deserving teams of families are selected from hundreds of applications to win a set of new wheels. A host turns up unexpectedly on their doorsteps with a huge trailer of gift-wrapped cars and invites them to follow him (in their current undesirable car) to a secret hangar. When they enter, the hangar is full of glistening models - cars they could never dream of owning, and yet in Trade Up they have a chance to get in one and drive it away! That is, if they are smart enough... Two rows of five identical cars gradually increasing in value, sit gleaming under the lights, one \"jack pot\" car is parked at the end of the two rows.

If they can put it in the ignition and start the car, it's theirs! But hold on, there are two teams playing and only one can win.

Fyodor Chytruk, then a young art student, saw these films and didn't believe his eyes; he was convinced that he had seen a miracle unfolding before him. What he didn't know was that one day he himself would become one of the greats of Russian animation. Through his personal story, we discover a magical art form that remained closed behind the Iron Curtain for decades. Compared to the other arts - especially literature and theater - the animated films, considered a children's art form, passed relatively easily through the strict censorship of the Soviet Union. Like all Soviet institutions, the animation studios Soyuzmultfilm enjoyed full government support, a fact that provided the artists with generous production budgets as well as distribution in 112,000 cinemas around the USSR. This situation allowed for the development of a tradition of animation style that was not only for children. Magia Russica moves between the sights and sounds of the Russian landscape, and into those of the animated films themselves. The films reflected not only the difficult though humor-filled Soviet experience, but also the rich cultural heritage of Russia, with Pushkin as its spiritual father. Today, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, as Russia makes the transition into capitalism, the animation artists discover that the rules of the market and ratings are not necessarily less restrictive than ideological censorship. In a rare look into the artistic process, at the creation of magic, the artists share their ideas about art, about cinema and about the way in which these should be related to.

Calling themselves the Black Panthers, this group of rebellious young Mizrahi men was intensely critical of racism and class bias within the Israeli establishment. They embraced Robin Hood-like campaigns such as \"Operation Milk,\" which stole food from rich areas in Jerusalem and distributed it to impoverished immigrants. Their bold moves captured the attention of the young and disenfranchised while earning the animosity of others (Golda Meir called them barbarians). Thirty years ago, as a novice filmmaker, Nissim Mossek set out to document the Panthers' burgeoning movement, following their demonstrations and ferocious confrontations with police. He and the Panthers had no compunctions about waking up families in the middle of the night to ask them to \"present their poverty\" to the camera, hoping to inform the public about the struggle for equality within Israeli society and incite others to action. Mossek's 1970s protest film vanished suspiciously just after completion; for years it was believed to be lost.

The second is a dead body that disappears once the police arrive.", "Nick Slaughter, an ex-RCMP and DEA agent, who had dropped out of society after being fired from his job, relocates to the Florida town of Key Mariah to start a detective service. In the process he meets Sylvie Gerard, a local travel agent. Together they form a strong partnership and quite the detective team. However, the local police squad never made it easy so they often require help from their friends: Ian, Spider (owners of the Tropical Heat Bar at different times) and Rollie (local police mortician). The Town of Key Mariah will never be the same again thanks to Nick Slaughter and company."]
